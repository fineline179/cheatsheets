\section{Distributions}
\subsection{Gaussians}
To start with, remember that
\begin{equation}
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx \, e^{-\alpha x^2} =
  \left(\frac{\pi}{\alpha}\right)^{1/2}, \qquad \alpha = \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\sigma^2$ is the variance of a Gaussian distribution.

\subsection{Bernoulli}
For $x \in \{0, 1\}$, Bernoulli dist parametrized by $\mu$, with
\begin{equation}
  p(x; \mu) = \mu^x (1-\mu)^{1-x}
\end{equation}

\section{Information Theory}
\paragraph{KL divergence:}
\begin{align}
  KL\big[p(x) || q(x)\big] &= \sum_{x_i} p(x_i) \log\left(\frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)}
                             \right) = -\sum_{x_i} p(x_i)
                             \log\left(\frac{q(x_i)}{p(x_i)} \right) \nncr
  &= -\sum_{x_i} p(x_i) \log q(x_i) + \sum_{x_i} p(x_i) \log p(x_i) \nncr
  &= H(p,q) - H(p)
\end{align}
where $H(p,q)$ is the cross entropy, and $H(p)$ is the entropy.
